## üìÅ Project Overview

The dashboard focuses on exploring:

- Job Count across different roles  
- Required Skills and their frequency  
- Median Yearly and Hourly Salaries  
- Salary distribution across job titles  
- Skill requirements per job  
- Country-wise and job title-wise filtering

This version improves upon v1 by applying advanced data modeling and more complex logic using DAX and Power Query.
