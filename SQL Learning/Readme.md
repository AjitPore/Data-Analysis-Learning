# 🛢️ SQL Learning

This folder is part of my data analyst learning journey and contains all SQL-related practice work and projects.  
Each subfolder represents a different database technology, making it easy to keep things organized and scalable.

Currently, I’m working with **PostgreSQL**, where I’ve focused on learning SQL fundamentals through topic-wise exercises and real-world inspired mini-projects.  
In upcoming phases, I plan to explore other databases like **MySQL**, **SQLite**, and **MongoDB** to broaden my experience across both relational and non-relational systems.
